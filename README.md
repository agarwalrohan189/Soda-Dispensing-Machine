# Soda Dispensing Machine

This repository contains a working prototype of a Soda Dispensing Machine using 8086 microprocessor and based on the Proteus Software. The folder also contains a hand-made multipage circuit diagram, the assembly language code for programming the micropreocessor and the IC-datasheets of all the components used. This project was completed as a group(5 members) project under the institution course Microprocessor Programming ans Interfacing. The details are given as follows:-

Designing a soda dispensing machine which offers 3 choices of cool drinks and 3 choices of quantities for each drink. The quantity is dispensed when required number of five-rupee coins are entered into the machine corresponding to the quantity of drink selected.

The Technical Specifications are as follows:-
Quantities offered are 50ml,100ml and 150 ml for small, medium and large respectively which are dispensed for 1, 2 and 3 five-ruppee coins respectively.
Corresponding to each button there is an attached LED, which indicated the press of user.
3 more LEDs to indicate insufficiency of the drink with respect to the quantity chosen.
Each drink has a seperate dispensor controlled by a seperate motor.
